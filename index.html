      <h2>About the Live Server</h2>
      <p>
        This server provides a live interface for a TEF6686 tuner from Mashpee, Massachusetts. Mashpee is located
        on Cape Cod, which is a prime location for FM DXing due to its orientation on a narrow peninsula. The receiver
        is about 2 miles from the water to the south, and 7-10 miles from the water to the north / northeast.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Antenna Setup</h2>
      <p>
        The system uses a 10 Element InnovAntenna mounted at 20' AGL. The antenna can be rotated manually and will be repositioned throughout the DX season.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SW (Southwest)</strong>: Default orientation outside E-Skip peak.</li>
        <li><strong>NE (Northeast)</strong>: Targets European DX during E-Skip season.</li>
        <li><strong>S (South)</strong>: Oriented for Latin American DX opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During the E-Skip season, my bias is toward South and Northeast reception. When able, and if user interest is high, I will add a second radio with an antenna always pointing Southwest.</p>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to deduce Antenna Orientation</h2>
      <p>Note: I highly recommend doing a scan with the "Spectrum" plugin and the visual should give a good clue as to antenna orientation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SW:</strong> 101.9 will be stronger than 99.9. 94.7 and 97.3 will be very strong.</li>
        <li><strong>NE:</strong> 99.9, 101.1, 102.9 and 106.1 are the strongest signals.</li>
        <li><strong>S:</strong> 95.1 is similar strength to 99.9 and 101.9. Locals overall not quite as strong.</li>
      </ul>
