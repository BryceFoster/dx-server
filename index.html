      <h2>About the Live Server</h2>
      <p>
        This server provides live FM DX reception data using a TEF6686 tuner. The goal is to monitor long-distance FM signals, particularly during the E-Skip and Tropo seasons.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Antenna Setup</h2>
      <p>
        The system uses a 10 Element InnovAntenna mounted at 20' AGL. The antenna can be rotated manually and will be repositioned throughout the DX season.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SW (Southwest)</strong>: Default orientation outside E-Skip peak.</li>
        <li><strong>NE (Northeast)</strong>: Targets European DX during E-Skip season.</li>
        <li><strong>S (South)</strong>: Oriented for Latin American DX opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to deduce Antenna Orientation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SW:</strong> 101.9 will be stronger than 99.9. 94.7 and 97.3 will be very strong.</li>
        <li><strong>NE:</strong> 99.9, 101.1, 102.9 and 106.1 are the strongest signals.</li>
        <li><strong>S:</strong> 95.1 is similar strength to 99.9 and 101.9. Locals overall not quite as strong.</li>
      </ul>
